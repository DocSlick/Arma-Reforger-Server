# Arma-Reforger-Server
create a folder called steamCMD and extract the steamCMD.exe then run it.
create a ArmA Reforger folder and place the two .bat files in it
edit both files to have the correct directories
run the update .bat this will download the server files (make sure that windows firewall notification settings are set to notify you) 
run the start reforger server this first one will fail but will create the arma folders in documents
place the config.json in there and edit it with the proper directories public ip, keep the server id blank youll be assigned a unique id
start the server .bat again and if theres no issues it should start the server (Make sure you have 2001 UDP port forwarded)
